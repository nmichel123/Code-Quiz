This assignment required a lot more time than I expected. I am enjoying working on the quiz, but at the time of upload for grading I have only built the HTML page and a small list of placeholder questions. I will continue to add to the js files as well as continue building the rest of the site after it is uploaded for grading as this assignment is an excellent synthesis of all things we have been learning in class. In hindsight, I needed to dedicate much more time to building the site as well as the js logic. I had trouble with creating a start button that would shift the page to the questions section, as well as getting javascript to work with my bootstrap elements. If my grader has any advice on these elements I would be thankful.
